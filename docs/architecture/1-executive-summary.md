# 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the complete technical architecture for the AgentBelt AI agency landing page. The solution leverages Next.js 15 with React 19, deployed on Vercel, integrated with Supabase for data persistence, and optimized for performance and conversion. The architecture supports all 20 stories across 3 epics with a focus on rapid deployment and maintainability.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with API routes for dynamic functionality
- **Serverless-first** approach using Vercel Functions
- **Database-as-a-Service** with Supabase for minimal operational overhead
- **Edge-optimized** deployment with Vercel's global CDN
- **Component-based** architecture with TypeScript for type safety
