# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A clean, professional, and trustworthy design that immediately communicates competence without overwhelming visitors. The interface should feel modern yet approachable, using subtle AI-themed animations and interactions that demonstrate capability without being gimmicky. Every element should guide visitors toward booking a consultation, with clear visual hierarchy and purposeful white space that lets the content breathe.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Scroll-triggered animations** that reveal content progressively, keeping users engaged without distraction
- **Conversational AI chat** that feels like talking to a knowledgeable consultant, not a bot
- **Single-action CTAs** throughout the page that all lead to the same conversion goal: booking a consultation
- **Hover states and micro-interactions** that provide feedback and delight without slowing navigation
- **Progressive disclosure** of information - starting with high-level value props and allowing deeper exploration

## Core Screens and Views
- Hero Section - Immediate value proposition with animated background
- Services Showcase - Three-card layout with expandable details
- Interactive AI Demo - Embedded chat widget with sample queries
- Case Studies Carousel - Rotating success stories with metrics
- Contact Section - Form and calendar booking side-by-side
- Trust Bar - Client logos and certifications
- Footer - Minimal links to privacy, terms, and social proof

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The site will meet WCAG AA standards with proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, and clear focus indicators.

## Branding
Professional and modern aesthetic with tech-forward elements that don't feel intimidating. Color palette should convey trust (blues), innovation (accent colors), and clarity (plenty of white space). Typography should be clean and readable with a technical edge. AI visualization elements should be subtle and abstract rather than literal robots or brains. The overall feeling should be "boutique consultancy" not "Silicon Valley startup."

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Full responsive design prioritizing mobile experience (60% of B2B research happens on mobile). Breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768-1024px), and desktop (>1024px). Special attention to touch targets on mobile and ensuring the chat widget works seamlessly on small screens.
