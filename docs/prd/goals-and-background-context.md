# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Launch a professional AI agency landing page within 2 weeks to establish AgentBelt's digital presence
- Generate 10 qualified leads per month from businesses actively seeking AI implementation
- Achieve 20% conversion rate from initial consultation to paid proof-of-concept projects
- Position AgentBelt as a practical, results-focused AI partner for SMBs and innovation leaders
- Demonstrate AI capabilities through interactive elements that prove competence
- Create a frictionless path from visitor interest to consultation booking
- Establish thought leadership and credibility in the pragmatic AI implementation space

## Background Context

AgentBelt addresses the critical gap between AI's transformative potential and practical business implementation. While businesses recognize AI's value, they struggle with adoption due to complexity, over-engineered solutions from expensive consultants, or failed DIY attempts. Small to medium businesses particularly lack access to practical AI expertise that understands both technology and business realities. AgentBelt offers a pragmatic approach focused on rapid prototyping, measurable outcomes, and transparent pricing - positioning itself as "AI that actually ships" rather than theoretical possibilities.

The landing page serves as the primary digital touchpoint to attract businesses seeking AI solutions, showcasing the agency's capabilities through interactive demonstrations, quantified case studies, and a clear 3-step engagement process (Discover, Design, Deploy). This MVP focuses on establishing credibility and generating qualified leads within tight constraints of bootstrap funding and a 2-week timeline.
